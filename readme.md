### Getting started
This is a POC, mileage may vary

node >= 16.16.0

Gettings started:
```sh
# make sure everything is linked and installed
yarn

# build federated modules
yarn build 

# start module registry server
yarn start

```

In a new terminal instance (leave other one running)
```sh
# start demo application
yarn start:app
```

keep pressing enter :-)
